        "Google Colab is not intended for creating Minecraft servers, but it can be done. Google Colab promises to work continuously for 12 hours; however, it may close if there is no one actively reviewing the page or using the console. In essence, if the page detects inactivity, the process will terminate. The performance is approximately 12 GB of RAM, along with a processor with a speed of 2.2 GHz and 2 threads. This is better than many paid hosting services, but it lacks support and does not guarantee to be open all the time. Mods can be installed, but it is not advisable to overload it with too many, just like plugins. The primary limitation of this server is its processor, which is not very powerful. Any hosting for $12 can offer a server of higher quality. If you plan to create something for many users, using a dedicated hosting service is much better. The servers used are from Google along with the Ngrok proxy."
